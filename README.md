# Algorithms-and-stuff
Just a few algorithms implemented, unlike my other repositories I am making each one of the algorithms runable on their own in their own file except for BFS and DFS, these are however all in one file so no dependecy file needed. Both Breadth first search and Depth frist earch are in the same file called 'XFSGraph.java' .

## PLANNED CONTENT:
   ### Graph Traversals:  
        BFS [COMPLETE]  -> XFSGraph.java
        DFS [COMPLETE]  -> XFSGraph.java  
        Dijkstra's [COMPLETE] -> DSPGraph.java (Dijstras Shortest Path Graph)  
   ### Sorting Algorithms:  
        Quick Sort [COMPLETE] -> QuickSort.java  
        Merge Sort [COMPLETE] -> MergeSort.java
        Radix Sort [ NOT STARTED ]
