# Algorithms-and-stuff
Just a few algorithms implemented, unlike my other repositories I am making each one of the algorithms runable on their own in their own file 
without needing seperate runfile for all the cases.

  Graph Traversals:
      BFS [done]
      DFS []
      Djikstra's []
      A* []
  Sorting Algorithms:
      Quick Sort []
      Merge Sort []
      Radix Sort []
